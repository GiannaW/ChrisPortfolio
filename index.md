 <p>Welcome to my Portfolio.
Here you can find projects, papers, and videos of my current work.
</p> 
<p> Hello, my name is Chris  Herrera . I am currently a third year student studying Enviormental Science with a minor in Public Health at American University in Washington, D.C .As an environmental science major with a public health minor, one of my favorite things to see is how the two disciplines interact and intersect to work together. My passions for this also intersect with my identity as a first-generation, low-income, queer Latin American indigenous student who grew up in the DC area and who has deep ties to my spirituality and ancestral roots. All of these intersecting identities as well as my lived experiences gives me an outlook into life and how we navigate systems of oppression in a unique way and in a way that only other people in my community would understand.
